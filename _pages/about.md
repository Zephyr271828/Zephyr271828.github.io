Hi there, I'm Yufeng (Felix) Xu (许御风). I'm a junior at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) majoring in Computer Science. Prior to that, I studied at [Suzhou High School of Jiangsu Province(江苏省苏州中学)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou_High_School_of_Jiangsu_Province) from 2016 to 2022.

My research interest lies in **generative models, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and LM reasoning**. I was lucky to work with Prof. [Keith Ross](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-ross), [Li Guo](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo), [Shengjie Wang](https://sheng-jie-wang.github.io/), and [Chen Zhao](https://henryzhao5852.github.io/) during my study at NYU Shanghai. If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out by my [email](mailto:yx3038@nyu.edu)!
